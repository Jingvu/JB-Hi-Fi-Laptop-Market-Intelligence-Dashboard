## Data Pipeline Summary
This project covered the entire data lifecycle, from web scraping and governance to cleaning and Power BI visualization.

### 1. Data Collection & Scraping
- **Scraped product listings:** Used Selenium to extract laptop listings, prices, ratings, tags, and inferred brand names.
- **Fetched and merged technical specifications:** Pulled specs √¨normation from product pages, parsed JSON, and merged into the main dataset.
- **Data Governance & Management:** Saved daily scrapes, merged with duplication checks, auto-backed up, and validated schema and row counts.

### 2. Preprocessing & Data Cleaning (Python)
- **Initial Exploration:** Analyzed structure, data types, and distributions to guide cleaning and transformation.
- **Product Info Cleanup:** Standardized prices, cleaned text fields, flagged discontinued items, and dropped noise.
- **Technical Spec Cleanup:** Cleaned and bucketed specs, created flags, and ensured consistent formats across columns.

### 3. BI Integration (Power BI)
- **Final outputs:**\
    üìÅ results_tagged.csv ‚Üí pricing, tags, brand, and lifecycle flags.\
    üìÅ results_specs_cleaned_all.csv ‚Üí full product specs.
- Loaded into Power BI using Power Query, with additional transformations, grouping and calculations for dashboarding.
