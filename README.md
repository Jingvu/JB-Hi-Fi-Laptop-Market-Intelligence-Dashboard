## Project Status: Active & Refreshed Daily

This project moves beyond simple data scraping to build a strategic market intelligence tool. It answers the core business question: "What does it take to succeed in the competitive Australian laptop market?"

By capturing and analyzing live product data from a major retailer like JB Hi-Fi, this project creates a comprehensive overview of the pricing, specifications, and brand dynamics that define the industry, culminating in an interactive Power BI dashboard for strategic decision-making.

## Key Strategic Insights
The dashboard doesn't just show data, it reveals actionable insights. A hiring manager or brand strategist could use this tool to identify market gaps and competitive opportunities.

- **The Market is Sharply Divided into Tiers:** There's a clear split between elite, high-performance brands (Alienware/MSI averaging over $4.5K) and budget-focused players (Lenovo dominating the sub-$1K space). This reveals that a "one-size-fits-all" strategy is unviable, success depends on targeting a specific price tier.

- **Apple is Justified by Customer Loyalty:** Apple successfully commands high prices by delivering the highest customer satisfaction (4.4/5 rating). This demonstrates a powerful brand moat built on user experience, proving that specs alone don't win the premium market. Any competitor in this space must compete on brand and satisfaction, not just price.

- **A "Sea of Sameness" Creates a Mid-Market Opportunity:** The analysis shows a crowded mid-range market saturated with similar specs (Windows 11, Intel processors). This signals a significant opportunity for a brand to differentiate itself not on core specs, but on design, unique features (e.g., battery life, build quality), or a superior customer service experience.

- **Ratings Volatility Indicates Market Fluctuation:** The dashboard tracks day-over-day rating changes, revealing market sentiment in near real-time. This metric could serve as an early warning system for brand reputation issues or the positive reception of a new product launch.

## Data Pipeline Summary
To build this intelligence tool, I managed the full data lifecycle, from acquisition to visualization.

### 1. Data Collection & Scraping
#### - Scraped product listings:
  - Used Selenium (headless Chrome) to load all laptops from JB Hi-Fi by auto-clicking the “Load More” button.
  - Extracted product title, price, image URL, ratings, number of reviews, and promotional tags.
  - Inferred brand names from titles using a custom list.
